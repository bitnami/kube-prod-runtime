# Bitnami Kubernetes Production Runtime

## Description

The Bitnami Kubernetes Production Runtime (BKPR) is a collection of services that makes it easy to run production workloads in Kubernetes.

Think of Bitnami Kubernetes Production Runtime as a curated collection of the services you would need to deploy on top of your Kubernetes cluster to enable logging, monitoring, certificate management, automatic discovery of Kubernetes resources via public DNS servers and other common infrastructure needs.

## Requirements

BKPR has been tested to work on a bare-minimum Kubernetes cluster with three kubelet nodes with 2 CPUs and 8GiB of RAM each.

## Kubernetes version support matrix

The following matrix shows which Kubernetes versions and platforms are supported:
