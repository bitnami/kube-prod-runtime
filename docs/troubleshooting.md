## Troubleshooting AKS cluster creation

### Service principal clientID not found

If you notice the following error message from `az aks create`, it could indicate the Azure authentication token has expired.

    ```
    Operation failed with status: 'Bad Request'. Details: Service principal clientID: <REDACTED>
    not found in Active Directory tenant <REDACTED>, Please see https://aka.ms/acs-sp-help for more details.
    ```

__Resolution__:

Please clear your Azure profile directory with `rm -rf ~/.azure` and retry after logging in again.

## Troubleshooting BKPR installation

### Object with the same value for property exists

__[Reported in issue #242](https://github.com/bitnami/kube-prod-runtime/issues/242)__

If you notice the following error message from `kubeprod install`, it indicates that another Azure service principal with the same value exists.

```
ERROR Error: graphrbac.ApplicationsClient#Create: Failure responding to request: StatusCode=400 -- Original Error: autorest/azure: Service returned an error. Status=400 Code="Unknown" Message="Unknown service error" Details=[{"odata.error":{"code":"Request_BadRequest","date":"2018-11-29T00:31:52","message":{"lang":"en","value":"Another object with the same value for property identifierUris already exists."},"requestId":"3c6f59e9-ad05-42fb-8ab2-3a9745eb9f68","values":[{"item":"PropertyName","value":"identifierUris"},{"item":"PropertyErrorCode","value":"ObjectConflict"}]}}]
```

__Resolution__:

This is typically encountered when you attempt to install BKPR with a DNS zone (`--dns-zone`) that was used in a earlier installation on BKPR. Login to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and navigate to __Azure Active Directory > App registrations__ and filter the result with the keyword `kubeprod`. From the filtered results remove the entries that have the BKPR DNS zone in its name and retry the BKPR installation.
